If you're writing, go ahead and try to sound clever. You might fail and sound incredibly immature, but a fear of failure is disastrous for any creative endeavor. If you're designing something, go all out. Make it bold and loud, and if it turns out gaudy, you can fix it on the next iteration. This was what I tried to do [[exegesis]]' redesign, and so far I'm very happy with it.","parent":"posts/Minimalism-6-8-2021.txt","score":0.8286502185830238},{"content":"Is creative work painful by nature?

A styling library can provide some affordances that make things easier - easy theming, dark mode, conditional styles, etc. etc - but the fundamental painful experience of trying to express a visual idea in code cannot be ameliorated with better code tools.[[code]] [[ideas]] [[tools for thought]]","parent":"posts/untitled-9-24-2021.txt","score":0.8279879084300223},{"content":"\"Consider how each individual is affected by an overall philosophical justification of his way of living and thinking: he experiences it as a sun that shines especially for him and bestows warmth, blessings, and fertility on him; it makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich, liberal with happiness and good will; incessantly it refashions evil into good, leads all energies to bloom and ripen, and does not permit the petty weeds of grief and chagrin to come up at all. In the end one exclaims: How I wish that many such new suns were yet to be created! Those who are evil or unhappy and the exceptional human being - all these should also have their philosophy, their good right, their sunshine! What is needful is not pity for them.

I got a targeted Facebook ad for Fender's free online guitar course. I remember this very distinctly as the moment I decided to learn guitar; I had never really thought much about it at all before that. Deep within the entrails of Facebook's recommendation engine, some algorithm made an educated guess that I'd enjoy picking up the guitar - and it was right. For all the horrible things Facebook has done, this was a real positive-sum, Pareto optimal moment. Zuck got his advertising check, and I got a new hobby. And for all that has been blamed on the internet, I owe it everything. Everything that I love doing, I have learned to some extent from the internet, whether it be the web development skills that I built exegesis with, my amateur interest in philosophy, my childhood love for art, or my newfound interest in guitar. I believe it is mankind's most beautiful invention.","parent":"posts/Giant Robots-2-28-2021.txt","score":0.8170385641166815}]}
