I doubt I'll be able to do all of this, and if I fall short on time, I'll have to cut back on some of these activities.

It's all to easy to spend a day noodling on guitar, wanting to get better solely because I saw some guy play a fancy solo on Youtube, or to spend a day learning a programming language I'll never use because someone on Twitter praised it. This is a recipe for mediocrity, because progress takes sustained practice, and I can't sustain these sorts of \"inspirations.\" Instead, I want to think slowly and deliberately about what I want to get better at, and stick to a slow and steady plan to improve at it.
