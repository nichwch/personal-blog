Yesterday I released the first version of a project I've been working on for a while. It's called Synesthesia, and it's a social music journaling app. You can find it at [synesthesia.club](https://synesthesia.club).

I'll keep the description brief because I'd rather you just try it, but it lets you take notes on the songs you listen to, and organize those notes with tags and mentions of other songs. You can also share these notes on your public profile, which is handy if you want to share your inspirations with your band mates.

You can also see a [map](https://www.synesthesia.club/profile/0b6b5e78-406f-44f6-839b-1537e98226a7/map) of all the links between songs in your notes, and [annotate your playlists](https://www.synesthesia.club/profile/0b6b5e78-406f-44f6-839b-1537e98226a7/playlists/1GeybUR1YfELXoaGLnA8IE) with your thoughts.

This app feels like the culmination of everything I've been working towards in my 20s. I started working on my first software side projects in college when I was 20, and also started learning how to play the guitar around then. This project is a synthesis of almost all my interests: software, music, and design. 

It feels good to finally have it released. I hope someone other than myself finds it useful.
