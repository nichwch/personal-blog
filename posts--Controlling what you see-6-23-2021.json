On any major social media site? The overwhelming trend of the last decade has been to replace user-controlled feeds with algorithmically curated ones. When you go to a newspaper stand, you pick which paper you'd like, which section you'd like to browse, and which article you'd like to read. When you open Facebook, what you see is decided for you by an algorithm mathematically optimized to maximize the amount of time you spend in the app. In the first scenario, the experience is like browsing a menu and ordering a meal. Choices are offered, a deliberation is made. In the second scenario, the content is slop, and the user is a pig eating it from a trough.","parent":"posts/Giant Robots-2-28-2021.txt","score":0.880639759659005},{"content":"I'm convinced that algorithmic feeds are poisonous.

We can take down information into apps like Roam Research or Notion and recall them easily later, but it’s an overstatement to call them tools for thought. Recollection is such a small, basic part of thinking! There is so much more to thinking than simply remembering something accurately. I think we can acknowledge the benefits these apps bring while also admitting that better tools for thought should help us do more with ideas than just remember and recall.\" [[quotes]] [[Linus Lee]] [[tools for thought]]","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity-8-27-2021.txt","score":0.8491918572445185},{"content":"In my view, the whole movement of [[tools for thought]] (Roam, personal knowledge management systems, etc, etc.) is to make computers help us think better.
