I've also given up on using pencil, or charcoal, or anything except pen. I used to harbor a lot of guilt over this, because shouldn't an artist be able to use any medium? Of course, this is ridiculous, it'd be like asking a musician to be familiar with every instrument. It makes far more sense to get really good with one medium than to be mediocre with multiple (feeling some cognitive dissonance here with my desire to learn both the [[piano]] and the [[guitar]]...).

Sometimes it helps me get in the zone. When it happens, usually the music fades into the background and I'm not even noticing it - this is the sweet spot for focus. Music that I like too much actually distracts me, and music that I don't like enough bores me and I end up wasting time switching what music I listen to. Working without music doesn't seem to be an option at all. I hope maybe [[synesthesia]] will help change my music listening habits?

Here is a unique and strange property of programming: Making tools to program better itself involves programming. This is not true for music or art - the process of making a guitar is not the art of playing the guitar, the process of making paints is not the art of painting, and while luthiers and paint-makers are certainly artists in their own right (and are often good at playing the guitar and painting, respectively), they practice an art that is distinct from the art that they enable.","parent":"posts/Prometheus-2-13-2021.txt","score":0.8138043096944149},{"content":"On the other hand, creative tools for thought are by definition focused on something you could never find on Google - your ideas and experiences.
