//#On Entrepreneurship

There is an intrinsic conflict between entrepreneurship and polishing craft. 

Entrepreneurship is not neccessarily incompatible with "small projects" and staying agile, because entrepreneurs still have to pivot often. - but you're pivoting with respect to what customers want, not what will improve your craft, or what you're interested in. Good musicians do two things: practice sections they find difficult to play, and articulate musical ideas that they find interesting. They don't go out and call prospective listeners and ask what they'd like to hear.
