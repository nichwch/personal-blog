That feeling can get addicting, to the point where you hunger to make progress on a creative project even when you're burned out - you want to create something so badly you can't take a break without thinking about it, but you're too burned out to make progress on it. At moments like these, one craves divine creative stamina, the ability to create out of thin air effortlessly, to beam ideas from one's head into reality, to spawn an entire universe within the span of a week like the God of the Old Testament.[[personal-reflection]]","parent":"posts/Prometheus.txt","score":0.863743416007118},{"content":"Continue working on exegesis (and maybe some other personal projects)","parent":"posts/Goals for Spring Quarter.txt","score":0.862670756430732},{"content":"We shape technology, but technology shapes us as well.

I would look at other notetaking systems like Roam Research and feel threatened - my notetaking app wasn't as powerful as theirs, therefore my mind would be weaker than theirs. Every little imperfection, every unimplemented feature, every bug felt sacrilegious - this was my second brain I was building after all. Needless to say, this led to a lot of feature creep, because my second brain had to be perfect.","parent":"posts/Second Brains.txt","score":0.8603360136454791},{"content":"Priority 1: Code-related creative work (continue work on exegesis, other personal projects, learn more code, write more)","parent":"posts/Goals for Spring Quarter.txt","score":0.8597165677952362},{"content":"Working on a refactor for [[exegesis]] and [[synesthesia]], thinking about how to budget time.
