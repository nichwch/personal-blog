I'm again reminded of an aphorism from [[The Gay Science]], simply titled \"excelsior\" - \"Thou wilt never more pray, never more worship, never more repose in infinite trust - thou refusest to stand still and dismiss thy thoughts before an ultimate wisdom, an ultimate virtue, an ultimate power, - thou hast no constant guardian and friend in thy seven solitudes - thou livest without the outlook on a mountain that has snow on its head and fire in its heart - there is no longer any requiter for thee, nor any amender with his finishing touch - there is no longer any reason in that which happens, or any love in that which will happen to thee - there is no longer any resting-place for thy weary heart, where it has only to find and no longer to seek, thou art opposed to any kind of ultimate peace, thou desirest the eternal recurrence of war and peace: - man of renunciation, wilt thou renounce in all these things? Who will give thee the strength to do so? No one has yet had this strength!\" - There is a lake which one day refused to flow away, and threw up a dam at the place where it had hitherto discharged: since then this lake has always risen higher and higher. Perhaps the very renunciation will also furnish us with the strength with which the renunciation itself can be borne; perhaps man will ever rise higher and higher from that point onward, when he no longer flows out into a God.\"[[quotes]] [[Nietzsche]] [[philosophy]] [[The Gay Science]] ", "parent": "untitled-9-21-2021.txt", "score": 1.1453965902328491}, {"content": "In [[On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity]], I argue that the main value add of [[tools for thought]] is that they enable [[personal-reflection]] and creativity, not that they help us manage knowledge.
