{"Working on exegesis was a grueling affair at times. I rewrote the schema multiple times, rewrote the backend from scratch 2 months before release, chased countless UI bugs, and manually patched abandoned NPM packages. Part of it may have been due to my inexperience, but [working with ](https://nichwch.medium.com/making-yana-e3fade3f56e7)[rich text](https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480) is just a [difficult task](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1360298464349999108), period. At one point, I considered giving up after finding a rival writing app I thought I simply couldn't compete with - I have a copy of an unfinished essay I started writing on why I had given up tucked away somewhere.

We face a kind of creative asymmetry - to bring beauty into the world, it is neccessary to confront ugliness. Creating beautiful, original music requires endless, stupid, and frustrating scale practice, finger exercises, and theory study; behind the sublime beauty of a master's painting lies hours of practice filling sketchbooks with mind numbing still lifes and ugly anatomical mistakes. On the one hand, it seems paradoxical that beauty, freedom and originality require ugliness, servitude, and repetition. On the other hand, it is almost coldly rational - perhaps there is a kind of aesthetic entropy at play, like there's a set amount of beauty in the universe, and to \"produce\" any more of it, you first have to take on ugliness as a burden.[[music]] [[aesthetics]] [[art]] ":[],"Anyone who takes satisfaction in creative work knows how good it feels to make something. That feeling can get addicting, to the point where you hunger to make progress on a creative project even when you're burned out - you want to create something so badly you can't take a break without thinking about it, but you're too burned out to make progress on it. At moments like these, one craves divine creative stamina, the ability to create out of thin air effortlessly, to beam ideas from one's head into reality, to spawn an entire universe within the span of a week like the God of the Old Testament.[[personal-reflection]] ":[{"content":"I'll end with a haiku. \n\nNomad Hypertext\nPowered by semantic search\nGives inspiration","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.805160016594635},{"content":"I'll end with a haiku. \n\nNomad Hypertext\nPowered by semantic search \nGives inspiration","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.805160016594635},{"content":"It uses neural search to show you how your ideas are connected to each other.
