On the other hand, it is almost coldly rational - perhaps there is a kind of aesthetic entropy at play, like there's a set amount of beauty in the universe, and to \"produce\" any more of it, you first have to take on ugliness as a burden.[[music]] [[aesthetics]] [[art]] ":[],"Higher-order creativity":[{"content":"It uses neural search to show you how your ideas are connected to each other.
