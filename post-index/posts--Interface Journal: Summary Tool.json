One challenge is that a lot of functionality that could in practice be reusable sometimes has to be coupled into application logic - an example of this is the semantic search in Nomad Hypertext. It would be great if my (hypothetical) summarizer app could list out the themes I was writing about this week, and there was a modal where you could use semantic search to find all other instances in my notes where I've written about that theme. It would be even greater if I didn't have to rewrite all this from scratch. Unfortunately, since semantic search is baked into Nomad Hypertext as an application, not a separate service, I can't reuse that functionality super easily in another app.", "parent": "Interface Work: Stealth Button.txt", "score": 0.9326002332919008}, {"content": "I've been working on notetaking apps for years now.
