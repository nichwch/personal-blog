It took serious effort and ingenuity from really smart people to make these platforms accessible to regular people. Once upon a time, filesystems and personal computers were the dominant paradigm of computing, and it was web and mobile that were strange, inaccessible pipe dreams. Increasingly, the opposite is the case.","parent":"posts/The AI-first operating system of the future.txt","score":0.848765726086299},{"content":"Thinking about filesystems and how they have been unfairly maligned. If we put more effort into designing novel interfaces for filesystems, it would allow more people to exercise agency over their own data.

Both of these embody the opposite of the unix philosophy of small, simple, composable programs.
