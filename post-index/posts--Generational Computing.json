Learning NextJS and GraphQL was also very rewarding, and both technologies were used extensively in the final version of exegesis.

Clojure is the most interesting from a theoretical standpoint, since I've never used a lisp or functional language. Rust is interesting because I hate systems/low-level programming, but I suspect that might only be because I hate C, and maybe Rust's more modern features will sell me on it.
