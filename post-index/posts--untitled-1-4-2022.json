Roughly stated, this is the belief that in general, simple things are more beautiful, and that you can make things more beautiful by removing elements rather than by adding them.","parent":"posts/Minimalism.txt","score":0.8348879322621949},{"content":"What are examples of good minimalism? I don't like Paul Graham's prescription to write simply, but I like his particular brand of minimalism because it's a distinct flavor of minimalism. His minimalism reflects an engineer's mindset: the bright, precise, yet playful character of an innovator who views words as moving pieces in a sublime mechanism, parts to be optimized away for the beauty of the whole. I don't think this is true, but an aesthetic does not have to be true. I think it is laudable that Paul Graham writes as if he is programming because it expresses something true and unique about his character; I think it is wrong for him to say that writing is like programming. In other words, Paul Graham's writing philosophy mistakenly prescribes as universal advice what is particular to his own style. In other words, if you can be authentically minimal, then do it.","parent":"posts/Minimalism.txt","score":0.8297995460218808},{"content":"There are lots of tools for thought out there with names inspired by great empires or their capitals: Roam (Rome) Research, Athens Research, Vienna Hypertext, etc. etc. I like all of these apps and have taken inspiration from them.\n\nBut isn't it strange that they have such imperial names? Tools for thought aren't about hierarchy and order, they're about freeing your thoughts to mingle with each other.
