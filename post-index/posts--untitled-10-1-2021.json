I have noticed, however, that sometimes I'll sit down to work for 2 hours, and proceed to waste it all, until the last 20 minutes or so, when I become desperate to get something done so the entire period wasn't a waste of time. That 20 minutes is often incredibly productive. When I only have pockets of 30 minute breaks throughout the day to work on a project, it's like every break is that last 20 minutes of a 2 hour work period.
