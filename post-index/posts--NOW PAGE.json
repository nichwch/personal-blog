The reality is that there is a tradeoff between the approach of creative collaboration and the approach of an auteur. What creative collaborators gain through specialization and the combination of talents, they lose in the fidelity of their ideas' expression; what the auteur loses through not being able to harness others' talents, he gains through the ability to express an idea to its fullest. Naturally, the more talents the auteur is able to accrue, the less he needs others, and the more worthwhile the tradeoff of solo work becomes.","parent":"posts/On auteurs and language.txt","score":0.8239763785797699},{"content":"I do think it's far from clear which schedule is better, at least personally speaking.[[focus]] [[personal-reflection]]","parent":"posts/untitled-10-1-2021.txt","score":0.823455024725081},{"content":"Right now I'm listening to [Something About Us by Daft Punk](https://open.spotify.com/track/1NeLwFETswx8Fzxl2AFl91?si=bc9f206d498e4fdd), which might have something to do with how I'm feeling.
