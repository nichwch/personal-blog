This implies that tools for thought and notetaking apps are synonymous, but nobody really thinks this; a decent amount of creators in the tools for thought space object to their creations being called \"note taking apps\", and even the ones who self-describe their projects as note taking apps insist that they're more than just that. This makes sense - the term \"[[tools for thought]]\" evokes something incredibly broad and ambitious, while note taking is a mundane (and arduous) activity. Indeed, it'd be a crying shame if tools for thought were limited to just note taking tools.","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity.txt","score":0.88306782383192},{"content":"In my view, the whole movement of [[tools for thought]] (Roam, personal knowledge management systems, etc, etc.) is to make computers help us think better.

I got a targeted Facebook ad for Fender's free online guitar course.
