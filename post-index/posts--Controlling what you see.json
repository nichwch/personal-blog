{"I spend an inordinate amount of time on Youtube. Having noticed this one morning, I quietly told myself that I wouldn't check Youtube for the rest of the work session - only to find that I would unconsciously press \"Y+enter\" and let the address bar's autocomplete lead me to Youtube. I would find myself on the site, not remembering how I had gotten there. More importantly, the home page recommendations had learned my preferences incredibly well. As soon as I landed on Youtube, there would be at least one video there ready for me to watch. That morning, I got nothing done. Youtube's algorithm had figured out that I really liked watching short clips of Mad Men and provided me a steady drip-feed of them, which I gorged on instead of getting anything done.
