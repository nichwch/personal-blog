The current wave of backlink-focused apps have a compelling response to this objection, which is that they're not focused on just copying information, they're focused on capturing the connections between ideas. Fair enough. But why require the end user to manually copy information down? It seems that this could be done more effectively through an annotation layer.","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity.txt","score":0.8277168030932495},{"content":"I want to continue working on [[exegesis]]. There are still a plethora of features I want to build into the app. I have wanted to build something like this for a long time - I sort of did with my last project [YANA](https://yananotes.com/), but the core text engine was so limited that I had to start over from scratch (the product of which is exegesis). I want to sort out a formal list of features before a beta release, and an eventual public release.

I starting working on the first one on the bus back from my internship. I had an idea for a simple interaction - users should be able to highlight a piece of text, then add tags to that text.

The biggest pro is that it generates a static blog. There's no backend to maintain, and it's quite lightweight and loads fast, while also providing the benefit of semantic hyperlinks. The con is that since the index is precomputed, you can't search for arbitrary things like you can in nomad hypertext.","parent":"posts/What is Yurt.txt","score":0.8228886713849628},{"content":"I had some interesting ideas this morning on exegesis. The future of [[tools for thought]] should be social, and maybe people and profiles should be first order features in exegesis. Let me clarify what I mean by this. Right now, exegesis' model is very simple: you have pages, and you have tags that you can apply to pages and parts of pages. If there's a tag that has the same title as a page, clicking the tag will lead you to the page, and the page will show everywhere it's been linked. Simple, basic, backlinking.

Then, for each paragraph in a post, it queries the vector database for the 20 most similar paragraphs from all your notes. It stores these in a precomputed index.

I stopped using it after a bit, and didn't bother renewing the domain. I don't miss JAFT at all.
