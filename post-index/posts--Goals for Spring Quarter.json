The code I wrote towards the end was noticeably cleaner and more maintainable, mostly because I had familiarized myself with [[React]] hooks.

Clojure is the most interesting from a theoretical standpoint, since I've never used a lisp or functional language. Rust is interesting because I hate systems/low-level programming, but I suspect that might only be because I hate C, and maybe Rust's more modern features will sell me on it.
