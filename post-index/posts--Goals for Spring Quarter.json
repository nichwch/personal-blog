There are lots of tools for thought out there with names inspired by great empires or their capitals: Roam (Rome) Research, Athens Research, Vienna Hypertext, etc. etc. I like all of these apps and have taken inspiration from them.\n\nBut isn't it strange that they have such imperial names?

It's less about ordering your thoughts into a hierarchical empire, and more about letting them wander freely, so that they might bear fruit. \n\nThat's why I picked the name nomad hypertext.","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.8048809108339671},{"content":"I'll end with a haiku. \n\nNomad Hypertext\nPowered by semantic search\nGives inspiration","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.802665439922986},{"content":"I'll end with a haiku. \n\nNomad Hypertext\nPowered by semantic search \nGives inspiration","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.802665439922986},{"content":"The app is free and open source.
