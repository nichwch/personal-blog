{"In psychology, a common coping strategy recommended to anxious people is to envision the worst case scenario about something they feel nervous about, and try to acclimate themselves to it. For example, someone nervous about a piano recital might imagine themselves messing up onstage repeatedly until the thought no longer scares them. Here, someone imagines a scenario that disturbs them until it no longer disturbs them - until they're blind to their own fear.":[],"In some cases, it's smart to blind yourself strategically.
