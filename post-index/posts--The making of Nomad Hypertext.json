{"To be frank, I made some regrettable engineering decisions while making Nomad Hypertext. I built this during my Recurse Center batch and was focused on getting a working prototype out, so some shortcuts were taken. Nevertheless, reflecting back, I would say these shortcuts were not worth it. \n\nThe two big shortcuts I took were using Javascript instead of Typescript and using Electron instead of Tauri.
