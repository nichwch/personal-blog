The current wave of backlink-focused apps have a compelling response to this objection, which is that they're not focused on just copying information, they're focused on capturing the connections between ideas. Fair enough. But why require the end user to manually copy information down? It seems that this could be done more effectively through an annotation layer.

We can take down information into apps like Roam Research or Notion and recall them easily later, but it’s an overstatement to call them tools for thought. Recollection is such a small, basic part of thinking! There is so much more to thinking than simply remembering something accurately. I think we can acknowledge the benefits these apps bring while also admitting that better tools for thought should help us do more with ideas than just remember and recall.\" [[quotes]] [[Linus Lee]] [[tools for thought]] ":[{"content":"Finally, I'd like to talk about the name.
