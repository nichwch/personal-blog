We can take down information into apps like Roam Research or Notion and recall them easily later, but it’s an overstatement to call them tools for thought. Recollection is such a small, basic part of thinking! There is so much more to thinking than simply remembering something accurately. I think we can acknowledge the benefits these apps bring while also admitting that better tools for thought should help us do more with ideas than just remember and recall.\" [[quotes]] [[Linus Lee]] [[tools for thought]]","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity.txt","score":1.0000000000000002},{"content":"That leads to a broader question: why is it that most [[tools for thought]] are also seen as \"note taking apps?\" The introduction of [[roam]] research has inspired a number of other products with the same core backlinking functionality - all of which bill themselves as both tools for thought and note taking apps. This implies that tools for thought and notetaking apps are synonymous, but nobody really thinks this; a decent amount of creators in the tools for thought space object to their creations being called \"note taking apps\", and even the ones who self-describe their projects as note taking apps insist that they're more than just that. This makes sense - the term \"[[tools for thought]]\" evokes something incredibly broad and ambitious, while note taking is a mundane (and arduous) activity. Indeed, it'd be a crying shame if tools for thought were limited to just note taking tools.","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity.txt","score":0.9169727826629192},{"content":"Of course, this is a bit of a strawman.

Right now, exegesis' model is very simple: you have pages, and you have tags that you can apply to pages and parts of pages.
