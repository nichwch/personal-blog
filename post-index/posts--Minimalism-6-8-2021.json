I don't like Paul Graham's prescription to write simply, but I like his particular brand of minimalism because it's a distinct flavor of minimalism. His minimalism reflects an engineer's mindset: the bright, precise, yet playful character of an innovator who views words as moving pieces in a sublime mechanism, parts to be optimized away for the beauty of the whole. I don't think this is true, but an aesthetic does not have to be true. I think it is laudable that Paul Graham writes as if he is programming because it expresses something true and unique about his character; I think it is wrong for him to say that writing is like programming. In other words, Paul Graham's writing philosophy mistakenly prescribes as universal advice what is particular to his own style. In other words, if you can be authentically minimal, then do it.","parent":"posts/Minimalism-6-8-2021.txt","score":0.8715359395570751},{"content":"Silicon Valley has embraced an aesthetic of minimalism.

We face a kind of creative asymmetry - to bring beauty into the world, it is neccessary to confront ugliness. Creating beautiful, original music requires endless, stupid, and frustrating scale practice, finger exercises, and theory study; behind the sublime beauty of a master's painting lies hours of practice filling sketchbooks with mind numbing still lifes and ugly anatomical mistakes. On the one hand, it seems paradoxical that beauty, freedom and originality require ugliness, servitude, and repetition. On the other hand, it is almost coldly rational - perhaps there is a kind of aesthetic entropy at play, like there's a set amount of beauty in the universe, and to \"produce\" any more of it, you first have to take on ugliness as a burden.[[music]] [[aesthetics]] [[art]]","parent":"posts/Prometheus-2-13-2021.txt","score":0.8826753797735404},{"content":"An aesthetic/ethical frame of mind concerns itself with beauty and values.
