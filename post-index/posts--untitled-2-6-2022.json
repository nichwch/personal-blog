This certainly seems true to an extent - a lot of biographers think Spinoza built his system out of need to cope with his own loneliness. ":[],"However I think I can also provide a principled argument against this \"anti-ego/pro-transcendental\" (albeit one that is also somewhat psychological). Along the lines of Nietzsche's argument, philosophy is deeply personal, and more often than not it reflects contingencies about the philosopher's personality rather than uncovering deep timeless truths. It seems to be the case that most philosophers who argue in favor of something transcendental and against the \"ego\" or \"personal identity\" are self-effacing individuals already. It's not like they'd be giving up much by renouncing their personal identities. Also, it's not particularly impressive for someone who's naturally humble to preach the virtues of humility - in a sense it seems like they're simply deifying aspects of their personality, rather than presenting a principled argument.":[],"I do remember reading somewhere that Nietzsche admired Spinoza, so I'm curious to see how he resolved (or didn't resolve) the tension between his views on [[philosophy]] and Spinoza's.
