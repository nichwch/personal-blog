{"I haven't enjoyed reading something this much in a while. Usually I struggle to read more than 10 pages of something at a time, but I found this really engaging. Feels like the right level of philosophical sophistication for me right now - the concepts are comprehensible but still challenging and novel, and the biographical element adds a level of allure as well.

It seems to be the case that most philosophers who argue in favor of something transcendental and against the \"ego\" or \"personal identity\" are self-effacing individuals already. It's not like they'd be giving up much by renouncing their personal identities.
