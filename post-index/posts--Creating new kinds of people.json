I got a targeted Facebook ad for Fender's free online guitar course. I remember this very distinctly as the moment I decided to learn guitar; I had never really thought much about it at all before that. Deep within the entrails of Facebook's recommendation engine, some algorithm made an educated guess that I'd enjoy picking up the guitar - and it was right. For all the horrible things Facebook has done, this was a real positive-sum, Pareto optimal moment. Zuck got his advertising check, and I got a new hobby. And for all that has been blamed on the internet, I owe it everything. Everything that I love doing, I have learned to some extent from the internet, whether it be the web development skills that I built exegesis with, my amateur interest in philosophy, my childhood love for art, or my newfound interest in guitar.
