I don't like Paul Graham's prescription to write simply, but I like his particular brand of minimalism because it's a distinct flavor of minimalism. His minimalism reflects an engineer's mindset: the bright, precise, yet playful character of an innovator who views words as moving pieces in a sublime mechanism, parts to be optimized away for the beauty of the whole. I don't think this is true, but an aesthetic does not have to be true. I think it is laudable that Paul Graham writes as if he is programming because it expresses something true and unique about his character; I think it is wrong for him to say that writing is like programming. In other words, Paul Graham's writing philosophy mistakenly prescribes as universal advice what is particular to his own style. In other words, if you can be authentically minimal, then do it.

I've also given up on using pencil, or charcoal, or anything except pen. I used to harbor a lot of guilt over this, because shouldn't an artist be able to use any medium? Of course, this is ridiculous, it'd be like asking a musician to be familiar with every instrument. It makes far more sense to get really good with one medium than to be mediocre with multiple (feeling some cognitive dissonance here with my desire to learn both the [[piano]] and the [[guitar]]...).
