Here are a couple of examples of different minimal styles of writing. There's the terse, masculine minimalism of a writer like Hemingway: the minimalism of a distant father, fond of whiskey and cigars, who sees the use of words as emotive and thus avoids them. There's the technical minimalism of an author like Paul Graham, a minimalism that treats words like code, moving parts in a machine to be optimized away, possible sources of error to be eliminated. Then there's the pragmatic businesslike minimalism of online writers seeking a platform like David Perell, who view each word as effort expended by a possible reader, and therefore something to be minimized as well. These are only a couple examples of minimalism in one medium, writing - if we examine the visual and musical arts as well there are far more.

Take Google's icon redesigns. Not only are they significantly worse from a visibility standpoint, but they also express a confused and weak sense of direction, which is ostensibly to create a coherent \"brand image\" by making all the icons look really similar. But what is this \"brand image?\" Nothing, it's as empty as Google's mission, which slipped over the course of two decades from \"Don't be evil\" to its current sad, formless state. Generally speaking, cookie-cutter minimalism is ugly.

I don't like Paul Graham's prescription to write simply, but I like his particular brand of minimalism because it's a distinct flavor of minimalism. His minimalism reflects an engineer's mindset: the bright, precise, yet playful character of an innovator who views words as moving pieces in a sublime mechanism, parts to be optimized away for the beauty of the whole. I don't think this is true, but an aesthetic does not have to be true. I think it is laudable that Paul Graham writes as if he is programming because it expresses something true and unique about his character; I think it is wrong for him to say that writing is like programming. In other words, Paul Graham's writing philosophy mistakenly prescribes as universal advice what is particular to his own style. In other words, if you can be authentically minimal, then do it.
