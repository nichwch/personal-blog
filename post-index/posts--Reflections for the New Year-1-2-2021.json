Personally, however, the end of the this year is less significant to me than the release of [[exegesis]]. A lot of my time was spent developing this project over the last year, and now that it's finished, I have a lot more time to spend on other activities. I'm not really big on resolutions, but I do want to reflect a little on everything. Of course, I anticipate [[exegesis]] will help me organize my new endeavors.","parent":"posts/Reflections for the New Year-1-2-2021.txt","score":0.8749829386969963}]}
