There are lots of tools for thought out there with names inspired by great empires or their capitals: Roam (Rome) Research, Athens Research, Vienna Hypertext, etc. etc. I like all of these apps and have taken inspiration from them.\n\nBut isn't it strange that they have such imperial names? Tools for thought aren't about hierarchy and order, they're about freeing your thoughts to mingle with each other. It's less about ordering your thoughts into a hierarchical empire, and more about letting them wander freely, so that they might bear fruit. \n\nThat's why I picked the name nomad hypertext.","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.8169208469047742}],"First day of school.

When my Number Theory professor brought up the topic again, I wondered if he'd finally address it, and he actually did. He was candidly honest about it - induction was more of a philosophical topic than a mathematical one, but as a purely mathematical phenomenon it's due to the axiomatic conventions that mathematicians abide by. That's it. It's axiomatic. I guess that was the expected answer, but it puts to rest a question I've had for a while.
