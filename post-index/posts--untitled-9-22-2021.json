When my Number Theory professor brought up the topic again, I wondered if he'd finally address it, and he actually did. He was candidly honest about it - induction was more of a philosophical topic than a mathematical one, but as a purely mathematical phenomenon it's due to the axiomatic conventions that mathematicians abide by. That's it. It's axiomatic. I guess that was the expected answer, but it puts to rest a question I've had for a while.
