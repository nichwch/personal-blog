An instructor/student relationship is an institutionalized way to approximate this; how effective it is depends on the quality of the institution.

The book talks about Habermas' early work as addressing the emergence and decline of a \"public sphere\" in modern Europe, and how he broke from other Critical Theorists because he believed that the idea of a public sphere, while still ideological, could serve genuinely emancipatory ends.":[],"It also seems like [[philosophy]] requires a war-like state of mind - against others, against oneself, against philosophy itself. I'm again reminded of an aphorism from [[The Gay Science]], simply titled \"excelsior\" - \"Thou wilt never more pray, never more worship, never more repose in infinite trust - thou refusest to stand still and dismiss thy thoughts before an ultimate wisdom, an ultimate virtue, an ultimate power, - thou hast no constant guardian and friend in thy seven solitudes - thou livest without the outlook on a mountain that has snow on its head and fire in its heart - there is no longer any requiter for thee, nor any amender with his finishing touch - there is no longer any reason in that which happens, or any love in that which will happen to thee - there is no longer any resting-place for thy weary heart, where it has only to find and no longer to seek, thou art opposed to any kind of ultimate peace, thou desirest the eternal recurrence of war and peace: - man of renunciation, wilt thou renounce in all these things? Who will give thee the strength to do so? No one has yet had this strength!\" - There is a lake which one day refused to flow away, and threw up a dam at the place where it had hitherto discharged: since then this lake has always risen higher and higher. Perhaps the very renunciation will also furnish us with the strength with which the renunciation itself can be borne; perhaps man will ever rise higher and higher from that point onward, when he no longer flows out into a God.\"[[quotes]] [[Nietzsche]] [[philosophy]] [[The Gay Science]] ":[],"It's like an excess of rationality always ends eating itself. Those who take rationality serious enough end up directing rational criticism at rationality itself - a dynamic similar to what [[Nietzsche]] thought had happened to Christianity (that Christianity bore the value of truth-seeking, which ended up being turned against it). ":[],"Rational men at war with rationality":[],"In the introduction to the [[Habermas]] book, the author briefly discusses the Critical Theorists he spent his youth with, and how they believed rationality was man's only hope for emancipation. However, they also believed rationality had devolved into \"instrumental rationality\" - a kind of ruthlessly utilitarian rationality - that would also end up dooming mankind. Because of this contradiction, the Critical Theorists became extremely pessimistic. ":[],"Naturally, [[Habermas]]'s thoughts on the public sphere - which referred to salons, coffee shops and other public spaces in his day, and probably the internet today - are relevant to the social features of [[exegesis]]. ":[],"I could not help but find this extraordinarily similar to what the protagonist and narrator of [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Repair]] goes through - he starts as a scientist, looks for justifications for science in philosophy, becomes frustrated with philosophy and eventually embraces esotericism before going insane. The instrumental rationality that the Critical Theorists disliked seems roughly equivalent to the \"classical rationality\" Phaedrus talks about in [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Repair]] as well.
