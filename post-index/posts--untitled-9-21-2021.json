[[meta-acropolis]] [[ideas]] ":[],"More broadly, I wonder if the authoritarian element of learning comes from the instructor-student relationship.

I personally believe this is possible, but I've also heard very good arguments otherwise. The synthesis in my head is currently this: the instructor/student relationship is not neccessary, but a social learning environment is. To improve at something, we need to be around people better than ourselves, and a certain level of humility is required to learn from those better than ourselves. An instructor/student relationship is an institutionalized way to approximate this; how effective it is depends on the quality of the institution. I don't think it's the only way to achieve this however, and there are interesting experiments in cohort-based learning that could illustrate other ways to provide a social learning environment.[[meta-acropolis]] [[ideas]] [[Jared]] [[hyperlink-academy]] ":[],"Class starts tomorrow.

However, they also believed rationality had devolved into \"instrumental rationality\" - a kind of ruthlessly utilitarian rationality - that would also end up dooming mankind. Because of this contradiction, the Critical Theorists became extremely pessimistic.

The instrumental rationality that the Critical Theorists disliked seems roughly equivalent to the \"classical rationality\" Phaedrus talks about in [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Repair]] as well.

Those who take rationality serious enough end up directing rational criticism at rationality itself - a dynamic similar to what [[Nietzsche]] thought had happened to Christianity (that Christianity bore the value of truth-seeking, which ended up being turned against it). ":[],"It also seems like [[philosophy]] requires a war-like state of mind - against others, against oneself, against philosophy itself.

Who will give thee the strength to do so? No one has yet had this strength!\" - There is a lake which one day refused to flow away, and threw up a dam at the place where it had hitherto discharged: since then this lake has always risen higher and higher. Perhaps the very renunciation will also furnish us with the strength with which the renunciation itself can be borne; perhaps man will ever rise higher and higher from that point onward, when he no longer flows out into a God.\"[[quotes]] [[Nietzsche]] [[philosophy]] [[The Gay Science]] ":[]}
